- ‚úÖ Clicking bell opens dropdown
- ‚úÖ Pending requests are listed with:
  - Requester avatar and name
  - Relative time ("2 minutes ago")
  - Optional message
  - Accept and Decline buttons
- ‚úÖ Clicking Accept updates connection status to "accepted"
- ‚úÖ Clicking Decline updates connection status to "declined"

AND requester_id = 'user-a-id';
```

## üîç Debugging Tips

### Issue: Companion matches not appearing

**Check:**
1. Console errors in browser DevTools
2. Halaqa has at least 2 members:
   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM halaqa_members WHERE halaqa_id = 'your-halaqa-id';
   ```
3. Users have interests set:
   ```sql
   SELECT id, username, interests FROM profiles;
   ```
4. Users are available for connections:
   ```sql
   SELECT id, username, is_available_for_connections 
   FROM profiles 
   WHERE is_available_for_connections = true;
   ```

### Issue: Connection request fails

**Check:**
1. User is authenticated
2. No existing connection between users:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM companion_connections 
   WHERE (requester_id = 'user-a' AND recipient_id = 'user-b')
   OR (requester_id = 'user-b' AND recipient_id = 'user-a');
   ```
3. RLS policies allow insert:
   ```sql
   -- Should return true
   SELECT can_insert_companion_connections('user-a-id', 'user-b-id');
   ```

### Issue: Compatibility score seems wrong

**Debug:**
```typescript
// In useHalaqaCompanions.ts, add console.log:
console.log('Shared interests:', sharedInterests);
console.log('Activity score:', activityScore);
console.log('Final compatibility:', score);
```

## üìä Compatibility Score Examples

### Example 1: Perfect Match (100%)
- **User A**: interests = ['Quran', 'Hadith', 'Fiqh'], beneficial_count = 50
- **User B**: interests = ['Quran', 'Hadith', 'Fiqh'], beneficial_count = 52
- **Score**: 50 (base) + 30 (3 shared interests) + 20 (similar activity) = 100%

### Example 2: Good Match (75%)
- **User A**: interests = ['Quran', 'Hadith'], beneficial_count = 30
- **User B**: interests = ['Quran', 'Arabic'], beneficial_count = 35
- **Score**: 50 (base) + 10 (1 shared interest) + 15 (somewhat similar activity) = 75%

### Example 3: Potential Match (55%)
- **User A**: interests = ['History'], beneficial_count = 10
- **User B**: interests = ['Finance'], beneficial_count = 8
- **Score**: 50 (base) + 0 (no shared interests) + 5 (low activity for both) = 55%
