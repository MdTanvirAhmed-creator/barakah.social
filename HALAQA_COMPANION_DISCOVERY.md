## üìä Compatibility Algorithm Details

```typescript
// Base score
let score = 50;

// Shared interests boost (up to +30)
const sharedInterests = profile.interests.filter(i => 
  userProfile.interests?.includes(i)
);
score += Math.min(sharedInterests.length * 10, 30);

// Activity similarity (up to +20)
const userActivity = userProfile.beneficial_count || 0;
const memberActivity = profile.beneficial_count || 0;
const activityDiff = Math.abs(userActivity - memberActivity);
const activityScore = Math.max(0, 20 - activityDiff / 5);
score += activityScore;

// Cap at 100
score = Math.min(Math.round(score), 100);
```

### Scoring Breakdown
- **50-59%**: Potential Match (Basic compatibility)
- **60-79%**: Good Match (Strong shared interests)
- **80-100%**: Excellent Match (Very high compatibility)
