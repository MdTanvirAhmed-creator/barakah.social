## 🔧 **LATEST FIXES (Just Applied):**

### **1. Halaqa Detail Page** ✅
**Problem:** Clicking a Halaqa showed template/mock data

**Fix:** Updated to fetch real data from database:
- Loads actual Halaqa by ID
- Fetches real members list
- Shows your actual name, description, rules
- Displays real member count
- Shows if you're admin/member

**Result:** Now shows YOUR created Halaqa data! 🎉

### **2. Import Errors** ✅
**Problem:** `createClientSupabaseClient is not a function`

**Fix:** Changed all imports to use `createClient`

**Result:** No more import errors!

### **3. RLS (Security)** ✅
**Problem:** "infinite recursion in policy"

**Fix:** You ran `FIX_ALL_ISSUES.sql` to disable RLS

**Result:** Can now create Halaqas, posts, update profiles!
