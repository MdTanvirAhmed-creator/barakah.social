### 2. **CompanionTree Component**
Interactive network visualization showing companion relationships.

#### Features:

  - 80-100%: Green (Strong)
  - 60-79%: Blue (Good)
  - 40-59%: Orange (Growing)

  - Click to view detailed companion info
  - Animated entrance for each node
  - Selected companion detail card

- **Legend**: Color-coded reference guide

#### Implementation Details:
```typescript
// Connection strength determines visual style
const getStrengthColor = (strength: number) => {
  if (strength >= 80) return "border-success-500 bg-success-50";
  if (strength >= 60) return "border-primary-500 bg-primary-50";
  if (strength >= 40) return "border-orange-500 bg-orange-50";
  return "border-muted bg-muted";
};

// Radial positioning algorithm
const calculatePosition = (index: number, total: number, radius: number) => {
  const angle = (2 * Math.PI * index) / total;
  return {
    x: Math.cos(angle) * radius,
    y: Math.sin(angle) * radius,
  };
};
```

## 🔄 Data Flow

### Loading Companion Data:
```typescript
1. Fetch companion_connections where user is requester or recipient
2. For each connection, fetch the other person's profile
3. Enrich connection data with profile information
4. Calculate aggregate stats (avg strength, interactions, etc.)
5. Render visualizations and cards
```

### Managing Requests:
```typescript
1. User clicks Accept/Decline on pending request
2. Update companion_connections.status in Supabase
3. Show success toast notification
4. Refresh companion data
5. Remove request from pending list
```

## 🔗 Integration Points

### Database Tables Used:

- `profiles`: User profile information
- `user_matching_preferences`: Matching criteria (future use)

### Existing Components:
- `Avatar`, `AvatarFallback`, `AvatarImage`
- `Button`
- `Card`, `CardContent`, `CardHeader`, `CardTitle`
- `Badge`
- `Input`

### Hooks:
- `useCompanionData`: Fetches companion stats and pending requests
- Custom state management for tree/list view toggle

---

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

### Planned Features:
1. **Companion Groups**: Organize into custom categories
2. **Interaction Timeline**: Visual history of interactions
3. **Shared Activities**: View posts/beneficial marks together
4. **Strength Breakdown**: Details on what builds connection
5. **D3.js Integration**: More advanced tree layouts (hierarchical, force-directed)
6. **Privacy Controls**: Granular visibility settings
7. **Export Network**: Download companion data
8. **Recommendations**: Suggest companions to connect

### Performance Optimizations:
- Virtual scrolling for large lists
- Lazy loading for tree nodes
- Cached stats calculations
- Debounced search

## 📈 Connection Strength Algorithm

Currently using database value, but future calculation could include:
```typescript
connectionStrength = weighted_average([
  interaction_frequency (40%),
  shared_interests (20%),
  time_together (15%),
  beneficial_marks_exchanged (15%),
  study_partnerships (10%)
])
```
